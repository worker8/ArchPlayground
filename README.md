# Architecture Playground

I made this repo to learn about different Android Architectures. I want to evaluate the difference and practicality for various archs, so that I can choose the right one for different purposes.

Currently included in this repo:
- Simple MVP, with Unit tests
- Simple MVP using Rx, with Unit tests
- Simple MVVM using Android Arch Component (going to write the tests)

- more to come...
