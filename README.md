# Architecture Playground

![](https://bloggie.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaUVCIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e87b49ad1a15971bd07a5ef2b49442d90ac67293/archplay.gif)

I made this repo to learn about different Android Architectures. I want to evaluate the difference and practicality for various archs, so that I can choose the right one for different purposes.

Currently included in this repo:
- Simple MVP, with Unit tests
- Simple MVP using Rx, with Unit tests
- Simple MVVM using Android Arch Component (going to write the tests)

- more to come...
